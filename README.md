This project assists users in creating team profiles for their workplace. Using the inquirer package and node.js, a series of questions begin by asking the user to create a manager, after which, they will be prompted of whether they would like to add an engineer or intern. After the user has finished creating their team, upon selecting the option for no more team members, an html page will be generated featuring the users created team members. The styling of the team member cards utilizes CSS and bootstrap icons.
